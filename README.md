# Optimizing High-Throughput Taxonomy Classification Pipelines for Microbial Genomics
This project aims to automate and optimize the Kaiju taxonomy classification pipeline for large-scale microbial datasets while minimizing manual intervention.

## Overview

Microbial taxonomy classification plays a crucial role in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. With the increasing volume of sequencing data, automation in taxonomy classification is essential for improving efficiency.

## Objectives

- Automate Kaiju workflow to read compressed .fastq.gz files directly
- Develop a scalable pipeline for microbial data classification
- Reduce runtime and improve classification processes
- Generate comprehensive taxonomy reports automatically

## Methodology

### Tools and Technologies

- **Kaiju**: Rapid classification of metagenomic sequences using protein-level alignments
- **Python**: Automation of command-line processes and report generation
- **Linux Command Line**: File handling and command execution

### Database Setup

The project utilizes the pre-built Fungi database from Kaiju:
- `kaiju_db_fungi.fmi` (Index file)
- `nodes.dmp` and `names.dmp` (Taxonomy files)

### Key Features

- Direct processing of compressed .fastq.gz files
- Automated taxonomy classification
- CSV report generation with detailed taxonomic information

## Performance Improvements

- **Time Reduction**: 30% faster input processing
- **Scalability**: Processes 1 million reads in under 1 hour

## Sample Output

| readID | Domain | Phylum | Class | Order | Family | Genus | Species | Strain |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| read1 | Bacteria | Firmicutes | Bacilli | Lactobacillales | Lactobacillaceae | Lactobacillus | L. rhamnosus | strainA |
| read2 | Bacteria | Proteobacteria | Alphaproteobacteria | Rhodospirillales | Rhodospirillaceae | Rhodospirillum | R. rubrum | strainB |

## Performance Comparison

| Workflow Type | Time Taken (Minutes) |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Manual Extraction | 90 |
| Automated Workflow | 63 |

## Conclusion

The project successfully automated the Kaiju taxonomy classification process, reducing setup time and increasing classification efficiency by 30%. The pipeline generates comprehensive taxonomic reports suitable for microbial data analysis in metagenomics.

## Future Work

- Optimize pipeline for larger datasets
- Implement advanced error-handling mechanisms
- Explore integration with additional bioinformatics tools
